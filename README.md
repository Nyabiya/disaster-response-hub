# disaster-response-hub

Description:
This website is designed to suport in disaster response and management.

ðŸ’¡ Why I Made This
I come from any area whre its common for flash floods and landslides. I have never experienced but I have seen how it affects people. I wanted to make a platform which can be used to help. I know am a biginner but I will get better.

How I made it
I used VS Code.
The main pages are:
1. Index which is the landing page.
2. Alerts for live weather and emergency notifications.
3. Contacts for support in case of emergency.
4. maps for assisting with location pins.
5. resources, should be for any important information.
6. volunteer for recruiting and coordiantion of volunteers.

ðŸ˜¬ Challenges
Since am a beginner and it being first time trying html and CSS. It was quite challenging. I had to keep on redoing. The website is beginner but am super proud of myself :)

What I learned
Coding is Super FUN!
